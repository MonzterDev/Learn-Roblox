Upon joining the **Roblox Development Community**, I realized there aren't any extensively insightful resources for **Modern-Day Game Development** on the **Platform**.

This isn't to discredit any of the Learning Resources which do currently exist such as [**Roblox's Guides**](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/learn-roblox/all-tutorials). In a way, this is to expand upon them.

**Roblox's Guides** are useful for brand new Developers, but some of the **Guides** are also **flawed** in a few ways:

- Not following **best practices**
- **Outdated**
- Poor **demonstrations** or **examples**
- Not giving **enough details** on a **topic**

With those flaws in mind, we strive to help Developers of any age, learn how to develop on the **Roblox Platform**! We have courses which go through step-by-step, creating the most popular Roblox Gamemodes such as **Simulators**, **Tycoons**, **FPS**, & more!
