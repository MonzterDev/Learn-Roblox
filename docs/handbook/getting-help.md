Finding a place where you can **ask questions** and receive **answers** to your problems is one of the best ways to drastically **increase** your **learning** process!

## How to Ask For Help

Understanding how to ask for help is a very **important** lesson that everyone needs to learn when they begin programming. It's common for **beginners** to ask questions in ways that make it **impossible** for anyone to help them because of the lack of detail and necessary information.

The **key** to having your questions answered is to **make it as easy as possible for others to help you**!

Let's review a few questions and discuss how we can improve them.

### Example #1

!!! fail "Bad"
    guys pls help, so i did a script and animation for my sword but for some reason it wont let me attack, the script is right, can you guys try to help and find a solution, thanks!

* Didn't include any **Scripts** or **code** for other people to review
* Wasn't specific enough about what "attack" means

The user should've provided their **Script** or at least **lines of code** which handle the **attack**. They should've also specified what "attack" means, is the animation not playing, or is the enemy not taking damage? You do not want to leave any room for questions or assumptions about your own question.

!!! success "Good"
    Hey, I want my Sword to play an Animation each time a Player Right-Clicks while holding it. My issue is that the Animation isn't playing. I can confirm that Right-Clicking is being triggered by calling a print there.
    ```LUA
    Paste lines from the script here, which handle the Right-Click
    ```

### Example #2

!!! fail "Bad"
    help my leaderstats broke
    ```LUA
    Includes entire long script
    ```


* The question appears very **low effort**
* Wasn't **specific** enough about what is "broke"
* Included their **entire Script**

Although I previously said you should **include** your **Script** when asking for help, there can be exceptions. You should **prioritize including code relevant** to your **issue**. This is very common among new Developers who might not know where their issue stems from. Either way including too much information is better than not including enough!

!!! success "Good"
    Hey, I'm having an issue with my leaderstats. Whenever I start my Game, I'm unable to see the leaderboard popup at the top-right of the screen.
    ```LUA
    Paste lines from the script here, which handle creating the Leaderstats
    ```
