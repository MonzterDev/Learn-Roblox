Finding a place where you can **ask questions** and receive **answers** to your problems is one of the best ways to drastically **increase** your **learning** process!

## The Problem Solving Process

Let's go over a simple process to follow each time you run into an issue!

### 1. Identify your Issue

It might sound simple, but you should be able to directly **identify** and **articulate** the **issue** you're having. You'll find this challenging if you're a new Developer, but as you put in more time, you'll eventually be able to easily articulate your exact issue.

I'd recommend checking out our [Debugging Guide](#){target=_blank} to help with identifying your issue!

### 2. Google

Learning how to properly **Google Search** a topic is an extremely useful skill, especially when it comes to solving problems!

Considering the size of the Roblox Developer community, there's a huge chance that people have already run into the same problem you're currently stuck with, or have even had the same question about how to create a specific system.

To **improve** your **searches**, I'd recommend adding the word(s) "**Roblox**" or "**Roblox Dev**" at the **end** of your **question**. This will usually only bring up results directly related to Roblox Development.

Here are a few of my **past searches**, which might give you an idea of how to improve:

* "spectate camera roblox dev"
* "roblox random decimal"
* "prevent player from moving roblox"

If you're **unable** to find **answers** to your question, you might want to consider **another way** of asking the question. It sounds odd, but **rephrasing** the **question** can have drastically different results!

### 3. Discord Communities

Once you've put in the work of **researching** your **issue** and still haven't found any solutions, it's time to ask the question in one of the **community Discords**. The best part about the **community Discords** is you'll usually get a **quick response** and can ask for an **explanation** or **further questions**.

Usually, there is a **channel** called `#Scripting-Help`, `#Coding-Help`, or something similar in these **Discords** meant for asking your questions. Here are a few recommended **Discords**:

* [Learn Roblox](https://discord.gg/bfrANMFP8J){target=_blank}
* [Hidden Devs](https://discord.gg/hd){target=_blank}
* [Roblox Studio Community](https://discord.gg/robloxstudio){target=_blank}
* [Ro Devs](https://discord.gg/rodevs){target=_blank}

### 4. The Developer Forum

Posting on the **Developer Forum** is usually my last resort whenever I'm still unable to solve an issue. My issues usually get solved in the **Google** stage and if they don't **Discord** usually takes care of it. Whenever I use the **Developer Forum**, it's usually for something extremely niche like a question about a specific **Library**. You can certainly use it for more broad questions though.

Depending on the question, the **response rate** can be slow, compared to **Discord**, but you're very likely to get a response. With **Discord**, your **questions** can get lost if they aren't responded to quickly, but this usually isn't the case on the **Developer Forums**.

## How to Ask For Help

Understanding how to ask for help is a very **important** lesson that everyone needs to learn when they begin programming. It's common for **beginners** to ask questions in ways that make it **impossible** for anyone to help them because of the lack of detail and necessary information.

The **key** to having your questions answered is to **make it as easy as possible for others to help you**!

Let's review a few questions and discuss how we can improve them.

### Example #1

!!! fail "Bad"
    guys pls help, so i did a script and animation for my sword but for some reason it wont let me attack, the script is right, can you guys try to help and find a solution, thanks!

* Didn't include any **Scripts** or **code** for other people to review
* Wasn't specific enough about what "attack" means

The user should've provided their **Script** or at least **lines of code** which handle the **attack**. They should've also specified what "attack" means, is the animation not playing, or is the enemy not taking damage? You do not want to leave any room for questions or assumptions about your question.

!!! success "Good"
    Hey, I want my Sword to play an Animation each time a Player Right-Clicks while holding it. My issue is that the Animation isn't playing. I can confirm that Right-Clicking is being triggered by calling a print there.
    ```LUA
    Paste lines from the script here, which handle the Right-Click
    ```

### Example #2

!!! fail "Bad"
    help my leaderstats broke
    ```LUA
    Includes entire long script
    ```


* The question appears very **low effort**
* Wasn't **specific** enough about what is "broke"
* Included their **entire Script**

Although I previously said you should **include** your **Script** when asking for help, there can be exceptions. You should **prioritize including code relevant** to your **issue**. This is very common among new Developers who might not know where their issue stems from. Either way including too much information is better than not including enough!

!!! success "Good"
    Hey, I'm having an issue with my leaderstats. Whenever I start my Game, I'm unable to see the leaderboard popup at the top-right of the screen.
    ```LUA
    Paste lines from the script here, which handle creating the Leaderstats
    ```

## Discord

Here are a few **tips** to improve your **communication skills** and increase **response rates** in **Discord**:

### Use Code Blocks

You should always **paste** your **code** into a **Code Block** when using **Discord**. You can see an example of how to do this below:

=== "Example"

    ``` lua
    ```lua
        print("This is an example")
        if true then
            print("Nicely formatted!")
        endâ€Ž```
    ```
=== "Output"

    ``` lua
    print("This is an example")
    if true then
        print("Nicely formatted!")
    end
    ```

If you're still **unsure** of how this is done, while **writing** a **Discord message** do the following:

1. Use ++shift+enter++ to create a new line
2. Type three backticks (```)
3. On the same line as the three backticks type `lua` (Make sure there is no space between the backticks and the word)
4. Use ++shift+enter++ to create a new line
5. Paste the code
6. At the end of the last line of your code type three backticks (```)

You can learn more about **Markdown** on **Discord** [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)!

### Use Multiple Discords

If you're experiencing **difficulties** getting a **response** to your question in **one Discord**, try proposing your question in **multiple**!

Whenever I ask a question in a **Discord**, I usually **copy/paste** it to multiple servers. One of the main reasons I do this is because it **increases** the amount of **people seeing** your question, directly increasing your chances of getting an answer, and if you only ask in one Server, there might not be anybody there who has an answer or is willing to help you.

Once you get an **answer** to your question, it's **important** to go back to the other **Discords** where you posted that question and **delete** it, so others **don't waste time** on your already answered question.
