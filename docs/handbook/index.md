# The Roblox Scripting (Luau) Handbook

This **handbook** is meant to swiftly cover different aspects of programming with **Luau** in the **Roblox** environment. This is certainly a source you could **learn** from but is meant to be used more as a **reference**.

If you're looking for a **Course** to primarily **learn** from, which will hold you hand and really **guide** you, explore our [**Scripting Course**](../courses/scripting/introduction-to-scripting/index.md)!


The **handbook** is slightly inspired by [**The TypeScript Handbook**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).
