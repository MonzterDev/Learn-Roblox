## Visual Studio Code

Before using Rojo, you must install **Visual Studio Code** which is an extremely useful Code Editor. You can **download Visual Studio Code** from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

!!! warning

    Make sure you install **Visual Studio Code**, not **Visual Studio** as these are two different programs!

## Installation

### Visual Studio Code Extension

Once you have **Visual Studio Code**, you can get the Rojo **Extension** [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo). Simply click "Install" and this should open the Rojo **Extension** directly in **Visual Studio Code**, allowing you to easily install it.

### Roblox Studio Plugin

There doesn't seem to be an official download link for the latest Rojo **Plugin**, but you can always find it on the creator's (LPGhatguy) page [here](https://www.roblox.com/users/576473/inventory/#!/plugins)!

At the time of writing this, the latest version is **Rojo 7**, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/6415005344/Rojo-7).
