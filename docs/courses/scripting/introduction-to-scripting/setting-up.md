## Creating our Game

Before we begin **scripting**, let's **create** a new **project** which we'll work on during this course.

1. Launch Roblox Studio
2. Click the :material-plus:`New` button on the left side of the screen
3. Select the Baseplate template

We should now **save** and **publish** the **project** to Roblox, so we don't lose it.

1. Select the `HOME` tab on the top of the screen (to the left of the `MODEL` tab)
2. Click the :material-cog:`Game settings` button (to the left of the :material-account-multiple:`Team Test` button)
3. Click the `Save to Roblox` button
4. Change the "Name" field to whatever you want, and click the `Save` button

**Studio** might reload the place, and now our **changes** will be **saved** directly to **Roblox** and we can **modify** the game from any **device**!

## Setting up Studio

Let's make sure we have all the **tools** **enabled** in **Studio** that we need for this course!

1. Click the `VIEW` tab at the top of the screen
2. Enable all of the following tools: **Explorer**, **Properties**, **Toolbox**, **Output**, & **Command Bar**

Your **Studio** should look nearly identical to the image above.
