# What is Luau

**Luau** is the only scripting language used to develop **Roblox** games. It's maintained solely by **Roblox**, but is a fork of the popular scripting language **Lua**.

It was created by **Roblox** due to all the changes they made to fit the platform.

From a **Developer's** perspective, it's written nearly identical to **Lua**. **Roblox** also focuses on compatibility with **Lua** when making changes.

If you wish to learn more about [**Luau**](https://luau-lang.org/) or [**Lua**](https://www.lua.org/), you can browse their official sites for insightful information and helpful guides!
