## What is the Output
The **Output** is where the most important information will be displayed from our **scripts**! We'll constantly be using the **output** to view **errors** and **debug** our code.

You should see the **Output** tab at the bottom of your **Studio** window.

    If you **do not** see the **Output** tab, click on the `VIEW` button at the top of **Studio**, then click the `ðŸ–¼ Output` button to enable it.

## The Command Bar
The **Command Bar** can be used as another method of **running code** similar to **scripts**! The code written within the **command bar** is usually a **small task** or meant for **testing**.

You should see the **Command Bar** tab at the bottom of your **Studio** window, directly below the **Output** tab.

    If you **do not** see the **Command Bar** tab, click on the `VIEW` button at the top of **Studio**, then click the `ðŸ–¼ Command Bar` button to enable it.

## Printing to the Output
What you're about to learn will be one of the most commonly used knowledge throughout your entire scripting journey! We can send a message to the **Output** by using the **Command Bar**.

**Type** the text below into your **Command Bar** and hit **enter**:
=== "Text"

    ``` lua
    print("Hey, I did it!")
    ```

=== "Output"

    ``` text
    00:00:00.000  > print("Hey, I did it!")
    -  Studio
    00:00:00.000  Hey, I did it!  -  Edit
    ```
Upon hitting **enter**, you should see a similar message appear in your **output** as displayed in the **Output** tab above!

We just used the `print()` function in the **command bar** to display `Hey, I did it!` in the **Output**. This is a simple example of using the `print()` function and we'll be using it a lot throughout the course.

Congratulations you can now call yourself a **scripter** as you just wrote your first line of code and used a function!
