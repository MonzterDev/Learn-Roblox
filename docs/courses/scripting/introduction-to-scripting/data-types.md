## What are Data Types

**Data Types** are the classifications we use to specify what type of value a piece of data is.
Roblox itself contains many **data types** which you'll learn about throughout this course and on your own, but we'll go over the basic **Luau** ones in this chapter.

## Basic Luau Data Types

### number
Any number including both whole numbers and decimals.
``` lua title="Example"
print(1)
print(1.5)
print(.5)
```

### string
Any combination of characters surrounded by double quotes.
``` lua title="Example"
print("Hi")
print("I have 1.5 dollars")
print("")
```

### boolean
There are only two possible values for a **boolean**, either **true** or **false**. You can think of these as the answer "yes" or "no" to a question.
``` lua title="Example"
print(true)
print(false)
```

### nil
**nil** means doesn't exist. You can also think of the word "nothing."
``` lua title="Example"
print(nil)
```
