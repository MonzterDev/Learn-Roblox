## What is Rojo

[Rojo](https://rojo.space/) is a Roblox development tool which enables you to use external Code Editors while developing on Roblox and stay synced with Roblox Studio.

Since it enables the use of external Code Editors, you also gain the benefits which come with them such as [Version Control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) & other [Extentions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode).

Rojo is used by many reputable Roblox Development teams to create Roblox Games including **Adopt Me**, **Jail Break**, **Funky Friday**, & many others!

## Why Should You Use it

Rojo will make an unbelivably large improvement to your current Roblox Development workflow! The key benefit to Rojo is that it enables you to use the **most popular** Code Editor, **Visual Studio Code**. The difference between Roblox Studio's Code Editor and Visual Studio Code is night and day, you can't even imagine.

### Extensions

**Visual Studio Code** is an amazing tool on its own, but becomes even better with **Extensions**! Here are just a few of the commonly used ones:

* **[Roblox LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nightrains.robloxlsp)**: Provides massive improvements directly while you code such as: [Auto Completion](https://i.imgur.com/4sgYDii.gif), [IntelliSense](https://i.imgur.com/vHbKIJ0.gif), & much more!
* **[Selene](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kampfkarren.selene-vscode)**: Helps write correct Lua code. Imagine a Lua master looking over your shoulder and explaining your mistakes in realtime!
* **[GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)**: Suggest code and entire functions in real-time. It's basically an AI which has been trained and continues to train based on similar and your own code!

### Version Control

There are many **Version Control** tools out there, but **Git** is by far the most popular and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** is the most popular hosting platform. **Git** enables you to:

* Easily track all changes to your project
* Collaborate with others on the same project, while keeping the codebase synced
* Backup your project with each change, which can be easily viewed, tracked, and reverted

## Prerequisites

Before using Rojo, you must install **Visual Studio Code** which in its simplest form is an extremely useful Code Editor. You can **download** **Visual Studio Code** from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

!!! warning

    Make sure you install **Visual Studio Code**, not **Visual Studio** as these are two different programs!

## Installation

### Visual Studio Code Extension

Once you have **Visual Studio Code**, you can get the Rojo **Extension** [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo). Simply click "Install" and this should open the Rojo **Extension** directly in **Visual Studio Code**, allowing you to easily install it.
