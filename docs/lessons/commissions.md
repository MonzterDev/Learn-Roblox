Are you looking to make some quick Robux or hire someone to create assets for your game? This guide will make your commission journey much smoother!

## Portfolio

If you're interested in performing commission work in the Roblox community, you should have a portfolio that showcases your capabilities and previous work. Think of it like a resume - highlight your strengths, use as much media (images & videos) as possible, and make it easily accessible. Consider using a popular site like [Cardd](https://carrd.co/) for creating and sharing your portfolio.

## Initiating Contact

When contacting a potential commissioner, be sure to provide as much detail and context as possible. Your message should include:

* What you're specifically wanting
* The style, quantity, and any extra details
* The timeframe you need the job finished by
* The budget you're willing to spend

Here's an example of how you can initiate contact with possible commissioners:

## Terms & Conditions

Establishing terms & conditions upfront and before any work begins or payment is made is crucial for a successful commission. Some common terms & conditions that should be established are:

* Can either party resell or redistribute the work?
* Can the commissioner share media of the work?
* Refund policy

## Timeline

Creating a timeline helps both parties stay on track towards reaching their goals. First, figure out when you want the task finished by, then choose a few dates between now and then. For example:

In this example, the project was to be finished by May 2nd. Two milestones were set on April 19th and 25th. Additionally, a condition was posed to the commissioner that if they didn't reach the milestone on the 25th, a refund would be given.

## Payment Methods

### [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/)

PayPal is the most commonly used payment method besides Robux. When using PayPal, consider the following:

#### Friends & Family

People often request that payments through PayPal be sent as "Friends & Family" rather than "Goods & Services." The reason behind this, is that PayPal will not refund any transaction which has been sent as "Friends & Family." So the person requesting the payment this way thinks they are safe from chargebacks.

The truth though, is that "Friends & Family" payments are not immune to chargebacks and they can even get your PayPal account suspended. As it turns out, "Friends & Family" payments are only immune to chargeback if the payment was directly from PayPal and not a credit card company or bank. Additionally, PayPal has been known to suspend accounts who misuse "Friends & Family" transactions, which is extremely easy to track.

#### Refunds

Refunding through PayPal incurs fees.

#### Chargebacks

A chargeback occurs when someone disputes a transaction with their bank or credit card company, claiming that the transaction was "unauthorized" or that the "product was never delivered." Losing against a chargeback is unfortunately common, and banks and credit card companies tend to take their money back quickly. When responding to a chargeback request, provide as much detail, screenshots, and evidence as possible.

If you lose your battle against a chargeback, the next step is usually filing a lawsuit, if the amount of money lost is worth it.

#### Fees

When you receive a chargeback, you may lose all of the money and incur fees on PayPal. PayPal's fee is $20, while Stripe's fee is $15.

Remember to establish terms & conditions upfront, provide detailed information when initiating contact, and carefully consider payment methods to ensure a successful commission experience.

### Stripe

### CashApp, Venmo

### Robux

This is the only method which is easily availible to anyone under the age of 18.

There are no refunds or possibilities of chargebacks.

To receive Robux payments, developers often use **Game Passes**. Here's how it works:

- Create a Game Pass for your game
- Configure the Game Pass and set the "Item on Sale" to true
- Set the price and share the Game Pass link

It's important to note that when you establish a price for your Game Pass, you need to account for the 30% tax on Game Pass transactions. For example, if you set the price of your Game Pass at 1,000 Robux, you'll only receive 700 Robux. To receive a flat 1,000 Robux, you should add the 30% tax (300 Robux) to the price, resulting in a price of 1,300 Robux.

The value of Robux can be a bit tricky to understand. For example, if you were to purchase $10 USD worth of Robux, you'd get 800 Robux. If you were then to use that Robux to pay a commission of 1,000 Robux, it would be the equivalent of paying $2.80 USD! This is due to the Developer Exchange, which allows you to convert your Robux back to USD. When paying with Robux, it's important to realize that 1 Robux is worth $0.0035 USD.

For new developers, it may be wise to avoid paying with Robux at first, as they're literally losing money when purchasing Robux. However, once they start making Robux through their projects, it can be a convenient way to pay for services.
