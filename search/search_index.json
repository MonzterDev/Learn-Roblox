It's maintained solely by Roblox , but is a fork of the popular scripting language Lua . It was created by Roblox due to all the changes they made to fit the platform. From a Developer's perspective, it's written nearly identicle to Lua . Roblox also focuses on compatibility with Lua when making changes.
